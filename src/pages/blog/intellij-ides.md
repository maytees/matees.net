# The Pros and Cons of JetBrains IDEs

JetBrains is a popular software development company that provides a range of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for different programming languages and platforms. In this blog post, I'll explore the pros and cons of JetBrains IDEs, and explain why they can be both amazing and frustrating at the same time.

## The Wide Selection of JetBrains IDEs

One of the biggest advantages of JetBrains IDEs is the wide selection of IDEs that are available. JetBrains provides IDEs for many different programming languages and platforms, including Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript, as well as for specific frameworks and technologies like Android, .NET, and Flask.

This wide selection of IDEs is a huge advantage for developers who work with multiple languages and technologies. Instead of using a different IDE for each language or platform, developers can use a JetBrains IDE to write and debug code in any language or platform that JetBrains supports. This can save time and effort, and can make it easier to switch between different projects and technologies.

## The High Price of JetBrains IDEs

However, the wide selection of JetBrains IDEs is also a disadvantage, because it means that the IDEs are not free. While JetBrains offers a free version of some of its IDEs, the full versions of the IDEs are not cheap. A yearly subscription to a JetBrains IDE can cost hundreds of dollars, which can be a significant expense for individual developers or small teams.

The high price of JetBrains IDEs can be a barrier to entry for some developers, and can make it difficult for developers who are on a budget to afford the IDEs. It can also be frustrating for developers who are used to using free or open-source IDEs, and who are not used to paying for software development tools.

## The Amazing IntelliSense of JetBrains IDEs

Despite the high price and wide selection of JetBrains IDEs, they are still popular among many developers because of the amazing IntelliSense that they provide.

IntelliSense is a feature of JetBrains IDEs that provides intelligent code completion and suggestions. This means that as you type code, the IDE will automatically suggest variables, functions, and other code elements that you can use, and will help you to write and debug code more quickly and accurately.

The IntelliSense of JetBrains IDEs is one of the most advanced and sophisticated code completion systems available, and it can be a huge time-saver for developers who are working on large or complex codebases. The IntelliSense can also help to reduce the number of syntax errors and other mistakes in your code, which can save time and effort when debugging.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, JetBrains IDEs are both amazing and frustrating at the same time. The wide selection of IDEs and the amazing IntelliSense make them a valuable tool for many developers, but the high price can be a barrier for some developers. Whether JetBrains IDEs are worth the price will depend on the specific needs and preferences of each developer.
